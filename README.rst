Python for Nippers
==================

Learning to program is fast becoming an essential life skill to be taught
from a young age. This is not to make a world of software developers, or to
try and drive our kids to be Mark Zuckerberg. This is to ensure that our
children, even if they never progress beyond `hello world` get to understand
that the technology around them is there to do their bidding and not something
simply to be consumed.

A basic understanding of how software and the internet work will help our
children grow up with an ability to spot the ridiculous or the impossible
or the dangerous in the preaching of our politicians, our bosses and the
companies that provide the services becoming so crucial to our everyday lives.

Python is a great starting point. It's a full-featured, powerful and expressive
general purpose programming language with an accessible and readable syntax.
It is also available for free on pretty much any platform, including the
popular Raspberry Pi and friends, and it can easily be used to control robots
or build websites.

The author has found it easy to teach young children the fundamentals of
programming with Python. This text is intended as a workbook for those
children he works with. Hopefully it will be of use to others.
